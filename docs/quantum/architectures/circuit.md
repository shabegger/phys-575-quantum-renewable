# Quantum Circuit Model

The quantum circuit model describes a quantum algorithm as a series of step-by-step transformations of the state of the system. Since this process is often envisioned as a series of logic gates operating on one or more qubits in sequence, it is also known as the gate model of quantum computing. [[Ajagekar 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.186)]

The quantum circuit model is amenable to several approximate methods that may be applied to combinatorial optimization problems, like [QAOA](../algorithms/qaoa.md) and [VQE](../algorithms/vqe.md). VQE is also useful for quantum chemistry models. [[Ajagekar 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.186)]

Only a few applications are known to have exponential speedup, including integer factorization (Shor's algorithm) and solving linear systems of equations ([HHL](../algorithms/hhl.md)). [[Ajagekar 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.186)]
