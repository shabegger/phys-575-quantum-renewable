# Overview of Quantum Computing

Itâ€™s important to recognize that quantum computers can not solve every problem
exponentially faster than classical computers
[[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]. Many problems exist
in the same complexity class for quantum computers as they do for classical
computers, and given the expense of quantum hardware and typically
longer-running elementary operations, it is important to judiciously select the
problems on which quantum computing is brought to bear.
