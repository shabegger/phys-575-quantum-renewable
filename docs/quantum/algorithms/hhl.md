# Harrow Hassidim Lloyd Algorithm

Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd is an algorithm for extracting information about the solutions to linear systems of equations, requiring only O(logN) time on a system of N equations, as opposed to O(n) for classical algorithms. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

The HHL algorithm was developed in 2009 as a method to gain information about the solution, x, of particular classes of linear systems, Ax &eq; B. [HHL](https://quantumcomputing.com/strangeworks/harrow-hassidim-lloyd-hhl-algorithm)
