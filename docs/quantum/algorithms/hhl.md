# Harrow Hassidim Lloyd Algorithm

Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd is an algorithm for extracting information about the solutions to linear systems of equations, requiring only O(logN) time on a system of N equations, as opposed to O(n) for classical algorithms. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]
