# Harrow Hassidim Lloyd Algorithm

Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd is a quantum algorithm for extracting information about the solutions to linear systems of equations, requiring only <math><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mo>log</mo><mi>N</mi><mo>)</mo></math> time on a system of <math><mi>N</mi></math> equations, as opposed to <math><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>N</mi><mo>)</mo></math> for classical algorithms. Researchers are working on implementing the HHL algorithm and improving on the number of quantun gates required[[HHL](https://quantumcomputing.com/strangeworks/harrow-hassidim-lloyd-hhl-algorithm)], but it will likely require a fully fault-tolerant quantum computer to be used in practice[[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)].

The HHL algorithm was developed in 2009 as a method to gain information about the solution, <math><mi>x</mi></math>, of particular classes of linear systems, <math><mi>A</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>b</mi></math>, where <math><mi>A</mi></math> is an <math><mi>N</mi><mo>&times;</mo><mi>N</mi></math> matrix, and <math><mi>x</mi></math> and <math><mi>b</mi></math> are vectors of size <math><mi>N</mi></math>.
