# Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization

Annealing/optimization: Use quantum processes to find low-energy solutions. Includes Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like Quantum Adiabatic (sic Approximate?) Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The quantum speedup isnâ€™t well-known. Begin with a known state of the system and create an energy landscape that encodes the problem with large penalties for breaking constraints. Allow the system to evolve until it is in its minimum energy state (the optimal solution). Special-purpose quantum annealers (D-Wave) or general-purpose quantum computers can be used. D-Wave annealers are shown to improve on classical methods, including simulated annealing, on several NP-hard graph problems. [[Gianai 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]
