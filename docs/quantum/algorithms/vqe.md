# Variational Quantum Eigensolver

Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm that can calculate the ground-state for a quantum system. They work on contemporary NISQ devices, but to solve new problems in, for instance, biochemistry, will require between 100 and 1000 fully-connected qubits with low error rates.

VQE can be extended to solve nonlinear problems with polynomial scaling, rather than the exponential scaling required by classical computers. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]
