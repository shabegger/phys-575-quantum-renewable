# Quantum Chemistry and Materials Design

Photovoltaic materials which will enable photovoltaic cells that (see lecture notes for what we need: large bandwidth, etc?) are continuously in development, as researchers try to improve photovoltaic efficiency. As an example perovskite photovoltaics are flexible and have potential for high efficiencies and low cost of production but face issues with reliability and length of lifetime [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]. Chemistry simulations could help to make progress in this area.

Further photovoltaic efficiency improvements could come from multijunction cells, hot-carrier solar cells, intermediate band solar cells or multiple exciton generation. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

Batteries face issues with availability of resources, waste disposal and cost, but molecular simulations might help researchers develop next generation battery technologies. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

Condensed-matter problems like the crystalline structures of photovoltaics. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

Chemistry is a prime candidate for quantum simulation, because simulating a molecular system classically requires resources that scale exponentially with the number of electrons involved [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]. However, since qubits are described by quantum wave functions just like electrons, one needs only to find a suitable translation, typically based on second quantization, between the system of qubits and the system of electrons in order to simulate the system.

Quantum simulation applied to chemistry could provide solutions for energy storage or photovoltaic materials research. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]
