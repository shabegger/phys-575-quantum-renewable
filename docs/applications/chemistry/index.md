# Quantum Chemistry and Materials Design

Photovoltaic materials which will enable more efficient photovoltaic cells are continuously in development. As an example, perovskite photovoltaics are flexible and have potential for high efficiencies and low cost of production but face issues with reliability and length of lifetime. Further photovoltaic efficiency improvements could come from multijunction cells, hot-carrier solar cells, intermediate band solar cells or multiple exciton generation. Chemistry simulations enabled by quantum computing could help solve condensed-matter problems like the crystalline structures of photovoltaics and aid development of new materials.

Chemistry is a prime candidate for quantum simulation, because simulating a molecular system classically requires resources that scale exponentially with the number of electrons involved [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]. However, since qubits are described by quantum wave functions just like electrons, one needs only to find a suitable translation, typically based on [second quantization](../../quantum/models/jw.md), between the system of qubits and the system of electrons in order to simulate the system.

Quantum computing may offer substantial improvements in materials science and quantum chemistry due to the close link between the natural systems modelled and the devices themselves. [[Ho 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.021)]
