# Stability and Reliability

Regarding reliability, the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) has a reliability goal of one day unforced outage per 10 years. For the power system to continue functioning in case of a failure, such as that of a transmission line or electricity generating resource, extra power capacity must be made available quickly to prevent mismatches between supply and demand that could bring down the system. This problem could be closely tied to that of [unit commitment](planning/uc.md), but the system might also be modelled as an electronic system, where excitations away from equilibrium should quickly return to that state. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

Regarding stability, ANSI requires that voltages vary by no more than 5% from nominal (120V in US). [Groverâ€™s algorithm](../quantum/algorithms/grover.md) may be adapted to perform other types of search. One application may be to give the quantum computer a set of unsafe contingencies so it can search for scenarios that might lead to blackouts or grid instability. Quantum risk analysis algorithms that speed up Monte Carlo simulations, which are commonly used in power system reliability studies, have been demonstrated. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

[HHL](../quantum/algorithms/hhl.md) has an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithms for linear systems of equations. This might be used for state estimation of the power system, detecting dangerous anomalies. It can also be used to solve differential equations that must be evaluated to determine how the power system will respond to transient disturbances. However, HHL will require a large number of qubits and very low error rates, so it is unlikely to run on NISQ devices. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]
