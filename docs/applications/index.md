# Applications for Renewable Energy

By 2019, 29 states and DC had “renewable portfolio standards” [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]. The transition, which involves moving away from large, centralized generators to distributed and variable sources like wind and solar means a great deal of restructuring.

Bioenergy is more like a traditional fossil fuel in the contexts described by [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)].

The natural processes that provide renewable energy like wind and solar are variable and difficult to predict, which is a challenge for the electrical grid. Some renewable energy also represents a shift from a small number of large, centralized generators to many smaller decentralized generators, rooftop solar in particular. Dispatch of these generators is complex. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]

Problems identified as potentially problematic to solve using current computational methods as the number of elements increase and required reaction times decrease in power systems. [[Giani 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00786-3)]
