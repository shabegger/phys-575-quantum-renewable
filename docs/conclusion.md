# Conclusions and Discussion

Practical problems often belong to the class of mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems and cannot be mapped to [QUBO](quantum/models/qubo.md). These may require a fully fault-tolerant universal quantum computer to benefit from quantum computing. [[Ajagekar 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.186)]
